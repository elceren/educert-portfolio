# Frontend-Backend Integration

This document outlines the integration between the frontend React application and the backend Node.js API for the EduCert online education platform.

## API Configuration

The frontend application is configured to communicate with the backend API through a proxy setup. During development, all API requests from the frontend are proxied to the backend server running on port 3000.

## Authentication Flow

The authentication flow between the frontend and backend works as follows:

1. User enters credentials on the login page or registration form
2. Frontend sends credentials to the backend API
3. Backend validates credentials and generates a JWT token
4. Token is returned to the frontend and stored in localStorage
5. Frontend includes the token in the Authorization header for subsequent API requests
6. Backend middleware validates the token for protected routes

## API Services

The frontend uses service modules to interact with the backend API. Each service module encapsulates the API calls for a specific domain:

- `authService.js`: Authentication and user management
- `courseService.js`: Course listing, filtering, and details
- `enrollmentService.js`: Course enrollment and progress tracking
- `assignmentService.js`: Assignment submission and grading
- `examService.js`: Exam taking and results
- `certificationService.js`: Certification issuance and verification
- `reportService.js`: Administrative reporting

## Data Flow

The typical data flow between frontend and backend is:

1. User interacts with the UI (e.g., clicks a button, submits a form)
2. Frontend component calls the appropriate service method
3. Service makes an HTTP request to the backend API
4. Backend processes the request and returns a response
5. Frontend updates the UI based on the response

## Error Handling

Error handling is implemented at multiple levels:

1. API service level: Intercepts HTTP errors and provides meaningful error messages
2. Component level: Displays error messages to the user and provides retry options
3. Global error handling: Catches unhandled exceptions and prevents application crashes

## State Management

The application uses React Context API for global state management, particularly for:

- User authentication state
- Current course information
- Enrollment status
- Application-wide notifications

## Deployment Considerations

For production deployment:

1. The frontend will be built into static files
2. The backend will serve these static files
3. API requests will be directed to the same origin, eliminating CORS issues
4. Environment variables will be used to configure API endpoints for different environments
